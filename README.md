# Cite-Count ðŸ“– 

Citation information is often excluded from the final word count of school or university assessment tasks. Sometimes this difference matters. 

But getting a text's word count sans citations can be tedious or inexact, involving lots of text selecting or estimating.

Cite-Count was made to solve this issue. Paste your text into Cite-Count and it will tell you the word count with and without citations, as well as some other details.

**Things Cite-Count does not do:**

- Discriminate between bracketed content: *all* content between brackets is removed from the word count
- Exclude direct quotations
